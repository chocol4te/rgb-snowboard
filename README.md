# rgb-snowboard

Motion-based lighting for a snowboard.

I had a few spare parts lying around, and I thought an RGB snowboard would be pretty cool. Currently using and Arduino Pro Mini, MPU6050, HC05 BT module, 12A buck converter, 240 WS2812B LEDs over a 4M strip and a 3S 2.2Ah Turnigy LiPo. I unfortunatly don't have time for a PCB order, so the final project will be on a breadboard, in a takeaway carton.
